            <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a 
                muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail. 
                It is sexually dimorphic; adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is 
                a social species, forming groups called prides.

            <img src="https://d2cbg94ubxgsnp.cloudfront.net/Pictures/480x270/3/9/2/130392_Grizzly-bear-with-salmon_shutterstock_126888161---Hero.jpg"/>
            <p>Grizzly bears are large and range in color from very light tan (almost white) 
                to dark brown. They have a dished face, short, rounded ears, and a large shoulder hump. 
                The hump is where a mass of muscles attach to the bear's backbone and give the bear 
                additional strength for digging. They have very long claws on their front feet that 
                also give them extra ability to dig after food and to dig their dens.

            <p>Easily recognized by its coat of reddish-orange with dark stripes, the tiger is the 
                largest wild cat in the world. The big cat's tail is three feet long. On average the big 
                cat weighs 450 pounds, about the same as eight ten-year-old kids. It stands three feet tall 
                with teeth four inches long and claws as long as house keys.
